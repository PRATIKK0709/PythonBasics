## Python HOME
Welcome to the world of Python! Python is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. This guide will help you get started and understand the basics.

## Python Intro
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Let's start with a simple "Hello, PEACE!" example:

```python
print("Hello, PEACE!")
```

## Python Syntax

Python has a clean and straightforward syntax. Indentation is crucial for defining blocks of code. Here's a basic if-else statement:

```
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```

## Python Comments

Comments are essential for code documentation. Use the # symbol for single-line comments and """" for multiple:

```
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```

## Python Variables

Variables are used to store data. Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to declare the variable type explicitly:

```
x = 5 
y = "Hello, Python!"
```

## Python Data Types

Python supports various data types, including int, float, str, and more. Here's an example of different data types:

```
integer_number = 42
float_number = 3.14
text = "Python"
is_true = True
```

## Python Numbers

Python has built-in support for numeric data types. Here's a simple arithmetic operation:

```
a = 10
b = 5

sum_result = a + b
print("Sum:", sum_result)
```

## Python Casting

Casting allows you to convert one data type to another. Here's an example of casting from float to int:

```
float_number = 3.14
int_number = int(float_number)
print("Casted Integer:", int_number)
```
